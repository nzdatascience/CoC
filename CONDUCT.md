# Code of Conduct 

The New Zealand Data Science (NZDS) Slack Community is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience 
for everyone, regardless of gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or 
religion. We do not tolerate harassment at NZDS in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate in this community. 
Slack participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the community at the discretion of the 
community organisers.

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, 
body size, race, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, 
harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, 
and unwelcome sexual attention. Participants asked to stop any harassing behaviour are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behaviour, the community organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, 
including warning the offender or expulsion from the community. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is 
being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the community organisers immediately.

If you feel you have been harassed, please contact one of the NZDS team immediately and we will take it from there. 
Every complaint will be treated seriously. It is important that all our participants feel valued and safe while 
in our community.

*This code of conduct draws from the [Kiwi Foo Code of Conduct](https://www.baacamp.org/what-to-expect/code-of-conduct/) 
which itself is drawn from other upstream CoCs*
