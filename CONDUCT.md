# Code of Conduct 

NZ Data Science Slack Code of Conduct
Welcome!

* This is a relaxed message space but we are human beings so please behave appropriately.
* The primary purpose of this channel is to facilitate communication between analysts and data scientists working in NZ government, academia and CRIs.
* Other kiwis with an interest in data science are welcome to join the conversation, but it’s not a marketplace and we reserve the right to remove ads.
* Importantly, this space can be subject to OIAs
* Do not use this site for sharing data that might be considered sensitive or higher.
* Please use your work email address if possible.
* Please suffix your display name with your organisation (e.g. Richard Dean ESR). This is especially important if you are unable to use your work email address to register. You can make that change here: https://nzdatascience.slack.com/account/profile
* While most people reside in #general, there are many other channels. Please use the appropriate channel for your conversation: e.g. #r or #python.


The current admins are:

* Richard Dean of ESR

We want this to be a fun, pleasant, and harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form. Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
Discretion:


Please keep what's said in NZ Data Science confidential. Don't repeat or quote things said here without the affirmative consent of the speaker(s). 

Please be mindful that things you say here may at some point become public. We cannot prevent people from screencapping or otherwise logging this slack. We also can't guarantee that every member's login credentials and logged-in devices are secure. Files uploaded here can be downloaded by anyone with a login. Please exercise caution and refrain from sharing sensitive information that could harm you or others if it became public.
Message Retention:

Because this is a free slack account, we have restricted scrollback, but Slack--the company--retains complete logs of all channels and direct messages back to the creation of NZ Data Science Slack. Slack is a U.S. company and therefore subject to subpoenas from U.S. courts. Our logs may be subject to subpoena and could become public as part of legal proceedings.

Harassment:

Harassment includes:

    Offensive comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, sexual orientation, disability, mental illness, neuro(a)typicality, physical appearance, body size, race, or religion
    Unwelcome comments regarding a person’s lifestyle choices and practices, including those related to food, health, parenting, drugs, and employment.
    Deliberate misgendering or use of ‘dead’ or rejected names
    Gratuitous or off-topic sexual images or behavior in spaces where they’re not appropriate
    Simulated physical contact (e.g. textual descriptions like “hug” or “backrub”) without consent or after a request to stop.
    Threats of violence
    Incitement of violence towards any individual, including encouraging a person to commit suicide or to engage in self-harm
    Deliberate intimidation
    Sustained disruption of discussion
    Unwelcome sexual attention
    Continued one-on-one communication after requests to cease
    Publication of non-harassing private communication

Reporting

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact the admins. They'll respond as promptly as they can.

We will respect confidentiality requests for the purpose of protecting victims of abuse. At our discretion, we may publicly name a person about whom we’ve received harassment complaints, or privately warn third parties about them. We will not name harassment victims without their affirmative consent.
Consequences

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.

If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the admins may take any action they deem appropriate, up to and including expulsion from this slack and identifying the participant publicly as someone about whom we've received complaints.
